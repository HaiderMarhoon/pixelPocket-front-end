## ðŸ”Ž Background info:

We are building the Pixel-Pocket project as part of our studies at General Assembly's Software Engineering Bootcamp. We chose to create a game list app because we find gaming and game sharing both exciting and engaging. This project is an excellent opportunity for us to practice our React frontend skills while also working on the backend with technologies like Node.js and Express. Additionally, we are implementing token authentication to enhance security and user experience. We believe that mastering these technologies will be invaluable for our future careers as developers.
